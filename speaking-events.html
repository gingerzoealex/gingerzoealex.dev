			<h4>What Even is a Dataset?</h4>
			<p>Starting a new job is a daunting experience. Especially when it’s in a new subject area that you’re clueless about. It’s a situation we’ve all been in; and even after studying for years I’m sure a lot of us will question how much we know about the subject area. I started my first software developer job and was thrown into the weirdly interesting and frustrating world of CSVs and Python.</p><p>But what is data, and what even is a dataset? How can it be used with Python to create something useful and awesome? How can natural language processing help with this?</p>
<p>It turns out, you don’t need to be massively qualified to work with data, you just have to be willing to learn, make mistakes, and keep on trying - just like in any job!</p>

			<h3>Non-Tech Talks</h3>
			<a href="https://2018.nidevconf.com/sessions/zoegadonthompson/">NI Developer Conference 2018</a>
			<p>I knew literally nothing about coding until I started to study. On my first day of Java at foundation degree level I had no clue what was going on. Everyone had some experience with computers, IT or gaming and I was light years behind. I was asking my peers for help and getting stuck on everything. I was really feeling like I’d made the wrong choice of career path.
			<br>
To save myself from embarrassment I dove head first into the land of curly brackets and pizza meetups in an attempt to learn everything I could.
<br>
I’m going to share how I have managed an attempt at kick starting my career despite not knowing wtf I’m doing.</p>
