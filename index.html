    <h3>Hi, I'm Zoe</h3>

    <p>
      During the day I write code, & by night I write code & crochet things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love open source & open data, a love inspired by my first developer role with <a
        href='https://flaxandteal.co.uk/'>Flax & Teal Ltd</a> in Belfast. I mainly worked
      with PHP, Laravel, Python and Vue.js, & also used open data. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I moved to Glasgow in 2019 and now I work at the BBC in the Archive Services team, mainly using
      React, Node.js, & AWS tech like Lambda, S3, CloudFormation.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Things change so quickly - it's more important to have passion for what you do, rather than knowing exactly what
      you're doing.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I've organised events & volunteered for various organisations, such as Code Co-Op, Farset Labs, & Belfast Tech
      Families.
