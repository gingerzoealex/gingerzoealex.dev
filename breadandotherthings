becoming the person who wins the bread

why are workplaces inflexible around working hours for dads? 9-12 is not a good shift - spawn missed her dad so much so she would stay up until she's had sufficient playtime, and then she would be a complete nightmare to get out of the house the next morning. this led to a generally unhappy family, who were constantly divided. I couldn't keep up with housework or work, or volunteer time, or self led learning time (half of which sustain my mental health because I <3 them). Spawn dad was unhappy because those working hours are miserable. He's supported me and my career from the beginning, and now he couldn't. we seemed to have hit a wall because what I was setting out to do was no longer realistic. Following a few weeks of instability, we made the choice for him to be a SAHD (not sad, stay at home dad).

This shift is what I wanted. I get to focus on work, organising, mentoring, socialising - basically all the stuff I'm good at. My guilt should subside since spawn now has a 'full time parent'. ...the guilt should subside, right? Now that I have the feeling of freedom, the guilt is worse. I wanted to be able to be a strong parent who could balance a super busy life, but instead the majority of my energy can go towards not being a parent. I don't know if I feel ok with this.

Financially, we might be ok. Two incomes would be good. We haven't had that..ever, actually. Things were looking up when we both got amazing jobs at the same time, so this is a turn that our pockets may not be ready for. Junior devs are paid decently and now I can take on extra work... on top of all the unpaid, important stuff. There will be betting taking place soon on how soon I will burn out. I don't think I'd bet on myself, to be honest.
