A group often forgotten about in the tech community is parents. Most of us have families, and some of us created out own families. In either case it can sometimes be challenging to balance everything going on in our lives. I started my tech career after I had my child, and I felt I had to sacrifice a lot of time with her in order to give myself a good start. But why? For 3 years I’ve felt like a bad parent because sometimes I would prioritise work over spending time with my family. I imagine that a lot of us feel this way - so let’s talk about it. We work for basically 24 hours a day, and the most important thing we can do to manage this is talk about it and support each other.

Things we will cover:
- realising when you have to prioritise family
- realising when you actually do have to prioritise work
- making sure you have a support network
- making sure you’re supported in work
- pushing the social side of our industry to being more family friendly
- promoting openness & honesty to tackle the isolation that can sometimes come with parenting
